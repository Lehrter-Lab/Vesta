# Vesta

This repository contains backups of essential inputs for the Vesta model as well as scripts to handle mesh validation and model outputs.

## Extractnodes3
Looks in the ./outputs folder for target model outputs then selects target nodes from these files and compiles them to a tsv for legibility.

## Validation
This is a script to take tsv and csv files from USGS, NOAA, and interpretted SCHISM outputs and plot them station by station for model validation.

## points_to_bp
This script will take a shapefile or a hierarchical data format 5 file and generate a particle.bp file that can be plugged directly into SCHISM's particle tracking module.

## pth_to_netcdf
This converts the particle.pth file to a netcdf for future processing

## netcdf_to_visual
This takes the .nc file generated by pth_to_netcdf and calculates the residence (time of first exit from target domain - time initial) and exposure time (cumulative time in target domain) and generates a times netcdf. It will also append an inside/outside field to the original netcdf. If these outputs have already been generated, the script will automatically omit those calculations and begin with plot generation.
